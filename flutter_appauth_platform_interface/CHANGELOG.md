## [5.0.0]

* **Breaking change** `AuthorizationResponse`'s  constructor now includes `nonce` and has changed to take positional parameters
* `nonce` can now be specified for `TokenRequest` class. This is especially useful on Android as the AppAuth Android SKD had turned on ID token validation that results in nonce mismatch errors. These errors should no longer appear when using the `nonce` value returned by the `AuthorizationResponse` object after calling `authorize()` and passing the value to the `TokenRequest` when calling the `token()` method
* now uses `mocktail` instead of `mockito` as dev dependency for unit tests

## [4.1.0]

* Added `scopes` property to `TokenResponse` class and `AuthorizationTokenResponse` class that inherits from it. Thanks to PR from [leoshusar](https://github.com/leoshusar)

## [4.0.0]

* **Breaking change** `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration` constructor has changed to take named parameters
* Added `endSession()` method, `EndSessionRequest` and `EndSessionResponse` classes to support end session requests

## [3.1.0]

* Added the ability to specify the response mode for authorization requests. This can be done using the `responseMode` parameter  when constructing either an `AuthorizationRequest` or `AuthorizationTokenRequest`. This was done as the AppAuth Android SDK throws an exception when this was done via `additionalParameters`
* Updated Dart SDK constraints

## [3.0.0]

* Migrated to null safety
* `AuthorizationServiceConfiguration` and `AuthorizationResponse` now have `const` constructors

## [2.0.0]

* **Breaking change** Removed the `toMap` methods so that it's not part of the public API surface. This was done as these methods were for internal use. Currently `flutter_appauth` (version 0.8.3) is constrained to depend on versions >= 1.0.2 and < 2.0.0. As it's possible that plugin consumers were calling the methods via the plugin, where the platform interface is a transitive dependency, the platform interface has been bumped to version 2.0.0 instead of 1.1.0 to be safe.
* Added `preferEphemeralSession` to `AuthorizationRequest` and `AuthorizationTokenRequest` classes. Thanks to the PR from [Matthew Smith](https://github.com/matthewtsmith).

## [1.0.2]

* Fixes [issue #86](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_appauth/issues/86) where there was an error on casting `tokenAdditionalParameters` property upon calling the `token()` method. Thanks to the PR from [Sven](https://github.com/svendroid)

## [1.0.1]

* Specify the object type for the `instance` property within `FlutterAppAuthPlatform` instead of being dynamic

## [1.0.0+1]

* Add pub badge to readme

## [1.0.0]

* Initial release of platform interface
