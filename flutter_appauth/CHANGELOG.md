* Updated Android setup section in the readme around setting the redirect scheme via manifest placeholders. If you've experienced Android build errors that says `applicationName` can't be found then check the readme for updated instructions, which is to use the `+=` operation instead of `=` on the `manifestPlaceholders` property in the `build.gradle` file

## 1.1.0

* * Added the ability to specify the response mode for authorization requests. This can be done using the `responseMode` parameter  when constructing either an `AuthorizationRequest` or `AuthorizationTokenRequest`. This was done as the AppAuth Android SDK throws an exception when this was done via `additionalParameters`
* Updated Dart SDK constraints

## 1.0.0+1

* There are no functional changes in this release. The only changes done were to suppress warnings that were occurring as a result of making use of Android v1 embedding APIs for backwards compatibility

## 1.0.0

* Migrated to null safety

## 0.9.2+6

* [Android] community has reported that there seem to be instances where the plugin encounters a null intent on some devices upon processing a authorisation request.

## 0.9.2

* [iOS] Fixes release build issue about including a non-modular header that came about from release 0.9.1+1. If you experienced issues with 0.9.1+1 (in my experience only occurs if your iOS app uses Swift), please update to 0.9.2
